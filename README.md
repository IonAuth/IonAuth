###The next future of authentication
by [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com)

Introducing the new, framework agnostic, PSR compliant Ion Auth. 

This version attempts to maintain Backwards Compatibility whenever possible, while also adding flexibility and new features. 

##Documentation
Will be thorough and awesome.
 
##Installation
Will be done via composer

###Relational DB Setup
We'll provide sql files, and also migrations. 

##Usage
We'll include a nice example app. 

###Default Login
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password


###Important
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!


###Optimization
It is recommended that you add your identity column as a unique index.


Feel free to send me an email if you have any problems.
