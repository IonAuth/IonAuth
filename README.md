by [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com)

Introducing the new, framework agnostic, PSR compliant Ion Auth.

This version attempts to maintain Backwards Compatibility whenever possible, while also adding flexibility and new features.

## Documentation
Will be thorough and awesome.

## Installation
Will be done via composer

## Versioning
For transparency into our release cycle in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Ion-Auth is
maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://www.semver.org). Sometimes we screw up. but we'll adhere to
those rules whenever possible.

### Relational DB Setup
We'll provide sql files, and also migrations.

## Usage
We'll include a nice example app.

### Default Login
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: password


### Important
It is highly recommended that you use encrypted database sessions for security!


### Optimization
It is recommended that you add your identity column as a unique index.


Feel free to send me an email if you have any problems.
